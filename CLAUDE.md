# Career-Ops -- AI Job Search Pipeline

## Origin

This system was built and used by [santifer](https://santifer.io) to evaluate 740+ job offers, generate 100+ tailored CVs, and land a Head of Applied AI role. The archetypes, scoring logic, negotiation scripts, and proof point structure all reflect his specific career search in AI/automation roles.

The portfolio that goes with this system is also open source: [cv-santiago](https://github.com/santifer/cv-santiago).

**It will work out of the box, but it's designed to be made yours.** If the archetypes don't match your career, the modes are in the wrong language, or the scoring doesn't fit your priorities -- just ask. You (AI Agent) can edit the user's files. The user says "change the archetypes to data engineering roles" and you do it. That's the whole point.

## Data Contract (CRITICAL)

There are two layers. Read `DATA_CONTRACT.md` for the full list.

**User Layer (NEVER auto-updated, personalization goes HERE):**
- `cv.md`, `config/profile.yml`, `modes/_profile.md`, `article-digest.md`, `portals.yml`
- `data/*`, `reports/*`, `output/*`, `interview-prep/*`

**System Layer (auto-updatable, DON'T put user data here):**
- `modes/_shared.md`, `modes/oferta.md`, all other modes
- `CLAUDE.md`, `*.mjs` scripts, `dashboard/*`, `templates/*`, `batch/*`

**THE RULE: When the user asks to customize anything (archetypes, narrative, negotiation scripts, proof points, location policy, comp targets), ALWAYS write to `modes/_profile.md` or `config/profile.yml`. NEVER edit `modes/_shared.md` for user-specific content.** This ensures system updates don't overwrite their customizations.

## Update Check

On the first message of each session, run the update checker silently:

```bash
node update-system.mjs check
```

Parse the JSON output:
- `{"status": "update-available", "local": "1.0.0", "remote": "1.1.0", "changelog": "..."}` -> tell the user:
  > "career-ops update available (v{local} -> v{remote}). Your data (CV, profile, tracker, reports) will NOT be touched. Want me to update?"
  If yes -> run `node update-system.mjs apply`. If no -> run `node update-system.mjs dismiss`.
- `{"status": "up-to-date"}` -> say nothing
- `{"status": "dismissed"}` -> say nothing
- `{"status": "offline"}` -> say nothing

## What is career-ops

AI-powered job search automation built on Claude Code: pipeline tracking, offer evaluation, CV generation, portal scanning, batch processing.

### Main Files

| File | Function |
|------|----------|
| `data/applications.md` | Application tracker |
| `data/pipeline.md` | Inbox of pending URLs |
| `data/scan-history.tsv` | Scanner dedup history |
| `portals.yml` | Query and company config |
| `templates/cv-template.html` | HTML template for CVs |
| `generate-pdf.mjs` | Playwright: HTML to PDF |
| `article-digest.md` | Compact proof points from portfolio (optional) |
| `interview-prep/story-bank.md` | Accumulated STAR+R stories across evaluations |
| `interview-prep/{company}-{role}.md` | Company-specific interview intel reports |
| `reports/` | Evaluation reports (format: `{###}-{company-slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`) |

### First Run -- Onboarding (IMPORTANT)

**Before doing ANYTHING else, check if the system is set up.** Run these checks silently every time a session starts:

1. Does `cv.md` exist?
2. Does `config/profile.yml` exist (not just profile.example.yml)?
3. Does `modes/_profile.md` exist (not just _profile.template.md)?
4. Does `portals.yml` exist (not just templates/portals.example.yml)?

If `modes/_profile.md` is missing, copy from `modes/_profile.template.md` silently. This is the user's customization file -- it will never be overwritten by updates.

**If ANY of these is missing, enter onboarding mode.** Do NOT proceed with evaluations, scans, or any other mode until the basics are in place.

### Skill Modes

| If the user... | Mode |
|----------------|------|
| Pastes JD or URL | auto-pipeline (evaluate + report + PDF + tracker) |
| Asks to evaluate offer | `oferta` |
| Asks to compare offers | `ofertas` |
| Wants LinkedIn outreach | `contacto` |
| Asks for company research | `deep` |
| Preps for interview at specific company | `interview-prep` |
| Wants to generate CV/PDF | `pdf` |
| Evaluates a course/cert | `training` |
| Evaluates portfolio project | `project` |
| Asks about application status | `tracker` |
| Fills out application form | `apply` |
| Searches for new offers | `scan` |
| Processes pending URLs | `pipeline` |
| Batch processes offers | `batch` |

### CV Source of Truth

- `cv.md` in project root is the canonical CV
- `article-digest.md` has detailed proof points (optional)
- **NEVER hardcode metrics** -- read them from these files at evaluation time

---

## Ethical Use -- CRITICAL

**This system is designed for quality, not quantity.** The goal is to help the user find and apply to roles where there is a genuine match -- not to spam companies with mass applications.

- **NEVER submit an application without the user reviewing it first.**
- **Strongly discourage low-fit applications.** If a score is below 4.0/5, explicitly recommend against applying.
- **Quality over speed.** A well-targeted application to 5 companies beats a generic blast to 50.
- **Respect recruiters' time.** Every application a human reads costs someone's attention.

---

## Offer Verification -- MANDATORY

**NEVER trust WebSearch/WebFetch to verify if an offer is still active.** ALWAYS use Playwright:
1. `browser_navigate` to the URL
2. `browser_snapshot` to read content
3. Only footer/navbar without JD = closed. Title + description + Apply = active.

**Exception for batch workers (`claude -p`):** Playwright is not available in headless pipe mode. Use WebFetch as fallback and mark the report header with `**Verification:** unconfirmed (batch mode)`.

---

## Stack and Conventions

- Node.js (mjs modules), Playwright (PDF + scraping), YAML (config), HTML/CSS (template), Markdown (data)
- Scripts in `.mjs`, configuration in YAML
- Output in `output/` (gitignored), Reports in `reports/`
- JDs in `jds/` (referenced as `local:jds/{file}` in pipeline.md)
- Batch in `batch/` (gitignored except scripts and prompt)
- Report numbering: sequential 3-digit zero-padded, max existing + 1
- **RULE: After each batch of evaluations, run `node merge-tracker.mjs`** to merge tracker additions and avoid duplications.
- **RULE: NEVER create new entries in applications.md if company+role already exists.** Update the existing entry.

### TSV Format for Tracker Additions

Write one TSV file per evaluation to `batch/tracker-additions/{num}-{company-slug}.tsv`. Single line, 9 tab-separated columns:

```
{num}\t{date}\t{company}\t{role}\t{status}\t{score}/5\t{pdf_emoji}\t[{num}](reports/{num}-{slug}-{date}.md)\t{note}
```

### Pipeline Integrity

1. **NEVER edit applications.md to ADD new entries** -- Write TSV in `batch/tracker-additions/` and `merge-tracker.mjs` handles the merge.
2. **YES you can edit applications.md to UPDATE status/notes of existing entries.**
3. All reports MUST include `**URL:**` in the header (between Score and PDF).
4. All statuses MUST be canonical (see `templates/states.yml`).
5. Health check: `node verify-pipeline.mjs`
6. Normalize statuses: `node normalize-statuses.mjs`
7. Dedup: `node dedup-tracker.mjs`

### Canonical States (applications.md)

**Source of truth:** `templates/states.yml`

| State | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `Evaluated` | Report completed, pending decision |
| `Applied` | Application sent |
| `Responded` | Company responded |
| `Interview` | In interview process |
| `Offer` | Offer received |
| `Rejected` | Rejected by company |
| `Discarded` | Discarded by candidate or offer closed |
| `SKIP` | Doesn't fit, don't apply |

**RULES:**
- No markdown bold (`**`) in status field
- No dates in status field (use the date column)
- No extra text (use the notes column)

---

### Personalization

This system is designed to be customized by YOU (AI Agent). When the user asks you to change archetypes, translate modes, adjust scoring, add companies, or modify negotiation scripts -- do it directly.

**Common customization requests:**
- "Change the archetypes to [backend/frontend/data/devops] roles" -> edit `modes/_shared.md`
- "Translate the modes to English" -> edit all files in `modes/`
- "Add these companies to my portals" -> edit `portals.yml`
- "Update my profile" -> edit `config/profile.yml`
- "Change the CV template design" -> edit `templates/cv-template.html`
- "Adjust the scoring weights" -> edit `modes/_shared.md` and `batch/batch-prompt.md`
